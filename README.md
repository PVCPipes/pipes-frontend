# Pipes - Your go to website for Course Progression Evaluation

This website allows monash users to upload their csv files that are downloaded from Callista to out platform. In which results can be obtained once the processing is done.

<br>

Back End Repo [here](https://github.com/PVCPipes/pipes-backend).
Front End Website Link [here](https://cocky-mcnulty-e456f6.netlify.app/).

## User Workflow

1. Staff logs into the platform
2. Staff uploads the csv file generated from Callista
3. Results are then generated for the user
4. Staff can revisit the results using the link provided

<br>

## Features Offered

1. Simplicity - Simple "Upload & Go" platform allowing users to just upload everything in one setting.
2. Advanced Analytics - users are able to view various kinds of analytics from the results provided (e.g. missed core units, percentage amount of credit points achieved, etc.)

<br>

## Enabling Technologies

1. Next.js - Main Code Base
2. Firebase - Authentication of Monash Emails

<br>

## Limitations

1. Lack of access to Callista's database - would enable us to directly call the query endpoints instead of processing csv files

2. lack of info consistency on Monash Handbook - making it difficult to retrieve necessary data from Monash Handbook

<br>

## Future prospects

1. Integration with Callista - complementing the course progression framework

2. All backend to be put in Back End - easier management
