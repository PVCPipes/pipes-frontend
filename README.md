This website allows monash users to upload their csv files that are downloaded from Callista to out platform. In which results can be obtained once the processing is done.

## User Workflow

2. Staff uploads the csv file generated from Callista
3. Results are generated on another page, in which a link is provided for every generation of result
4. Staff can revisit the results using the link provided

## Technical Workflow

1. TBC

<br>

## Features Offered

1. Simplicity - Simple "Upload & Go" platform allowing users to just upload everything in one setting.

## Enabling Technologies

### Front End

1. Next.js - Main
2. Firebase - Auth

### Back End

1. Nest.js -
2. AWS - Server Hosting + DB Hosting

<br>

## Limitations

1. Lack of access to Callista's database - would enable us to directly call the query endpoints instead of processing csv files

2. lack of info consistency on Monash Handbook - making it difficult to retrieve necessary data from Monash Handbook

<br>

## Future prospects

1. Integration with Callista - complementing the course progression framework

2. All backend to be put in Back End - easier management
